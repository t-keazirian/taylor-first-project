            <h3>How did I get into coding, you ask?</h3>
            <p class="line-up second-p">My career for the past 10+ years has been in hospitality and restaurant management.  
                I thrive in a fast-paced, driven work environment, and loved working my way up from server all the way to Assistant General Manager.  
                My ability to be detail-oriented, goal-focused, and highly organized allowed me to excel in this field.  
                However, over the past year I found myself yearning for something more - a field where I could keep my mind sharp, 
                and a career that would challenge me in new, exciting ways.</p>
            <p class ="line-up">I grew up playing on computers since I could read, as my dad was involved in the early tech industry.  
                As I pondered my options for future careers, software engineering continually popped into my mind.  
                I knew it would be extremely challenging, but also rewarding.  
                I enrolled at Thinkful and never looked back!</p>
